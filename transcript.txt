1. Introduction & Background
Chairman: Good morning, Mr. Karthikeya Srivastava. Please have a seat.

Karthikeya Srivastava: Good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am. Thank you.

Chairman: How are you feeling today?

Karthikeya Srivastava: I am feeling a little nervous but excited as well, sir.

Chairman: Don't worry, we are just going to have a conversation. You are among the best candidates in the country, and we want to know more about you. Could you briefly introduce yourself?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, my name is Karthikeya Srivastava. I am from [City, State]. I have completed my graduation in [Subject] from [University]. I have been preparing for the Civil Services Examination for the past [X] years. Along with my studies, I have actively participated in [extracurricular activities/community service/research projects].

Chairman: That's great. Why did you choose to pursue civil services?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, I believe civil services provide an opportunity to work at the grassroots level and make a tangible impact on people's lives. My inclination towards public service was inspired by [an incident/person/event], and I see this as a way to contribute meaningfully to society.

2. Academic & Optional Subject
Member 1 (Academician): You have graduated in [Subject]. How do you think your academic background will help you as a civil servant?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, my academic background in [Subject] has helped me develop analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of [relevant areas]. For example, [specific subject knowledge] can be applied in policymaking, governance, and public administration.

Member 1: You have taken [Optional Subject] as your optional. Some argue that this subject does not have direct relevance in administration. How would you justify your choice?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, while it may not have direct relevance in every administrative role, the subject helps in developing a structured approach to problem-solving and policy analysis. For instance, in [subject], concepts like [example] are applicable in governance, planning, and administration.

3. Current Affairs & Policy Issues
Member 2 (Economics/Polity Expert): The Indian economy has seen several structural reforms in the past few years. What is your opinion on the effectiveness of the GST system?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, the GST system was a landmark tax reform aimed at creating a unified tax structure across the country. While it has streamlined taxation and increased compliance, there have been challenges in its implementation, such as complex tax slabs and issues faced by small businesses. However, with continuous reforms and technological improvements, it is gradually becoming more effective.

Member 2: There is a debate about Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a potential welfare measure. Do you think India should implement it?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, UBI has its merits, such as reducing poverty and providing financial security. However, in a country like India with budget constraints and a vast population, implementing it universally may not be feasible. Instead, a targeted approach focusing on vulnerable sections could be more practical.

4. Behavioral & Ethical Questions
Member 3 (Behavioral Expert): Suppose you are posted as a District Magistrate, and a violent protest breaks out in your district. What steps would you take to control the situation?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, my first priority would be to ensure law and order while respecting citizens' rights. I would:

Deploy adequate police forces and ensure they use minimal force.
Engage with community leaders to understand their concerns.
Communicate clearly with the public through local media and social platforms.
Implement preventive measures like Section 144 if necessary.
Work on addressing the root cause of the protest to find a long-term solution.
Member 3: Good. Now, let's say you are faced with political pressure to approve an illegal project. What will you do?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, I would adhere to legal and ethical principles. I would politely explain to the concerned individuals that I am bound by the law and cannot approve anything that is not legally permitted. If required, I would escalate the issue to higher authorities or seek legal counsel.

5. Defense & International Relations
Member 4 (Defense/IR Expert): Given the current geopolitical scenario, how do you view India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, India has maintained a balanced and strategic approach, emphasizing dialogue and diplomacy while safeguarding its national interests. India has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and continues to engage with both sides. At the same time, India has focused on securing energy supplies and maintaining economic stability.

Member 4: India is actively strengthening its defense partnerships. What is your view on the QUAD alliance?

Karthikeya Srivastava: Sir, QUAD is an important strategic grouping involving India, the US, Japan, and Australia. It enhances regional security, promotes a free Indo-Pacific, and strengthens economic cooperation. However, India has been cautious to maintain strategic autonomy while engaging with all stakeholders, including China and Russia.
